 ## **Important Note**
The purpose of this Project sandbox is to offer you a space where you can work in VS Code without downloading it to your computer. The Project sandbox already has an empty HTML and CSS file that you can use to develop your home page.

Take note that you can use the Project sandbox multiple times but only for one hour at a time. Make sure you download your files to your computer before the session ends. To work on your project later again, you can simply copy and paste the HTML and CSS code from the downloaded files into the template files provided in the Project Sandbox. Remember to download the edited versions at the end of each session.


Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant, focused on traditional recipes served with a modern twist. The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture and have a menu of 12â€“15 items that they rotate seasonally. The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate prices, making it a popular place for a meal any time of the day.

Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant. To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy. Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional cuisines from the Mediterranean region.
